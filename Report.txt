                                    A case for two-way skewed-associative caches

Research Problem Statement

	        As the gap between the performance of microprocessor and memory performance widens, the penalty for accessing
  required data from higher level cache increases rapidly. Therefore, the miss rate is a key factor in deciding 
  the performance of the cache from its average memory access time. Since the size of the caches are often 
  constrained so as not to make the processor chip too large.
          In response to this problem, it is important to find ways of increasing the hit rate without simply 
  increasing the size of the L2 cache. One way to do this is through a different mapping function, where a certain 
  address is mapped to different blocks in each set, thereby reducing possible collisions.
